Task 10: Security Awareness

# Describe a few common security vulnerabilities in web applications and how to prevent them.
Security Misconfigurations: Improperly configured security settings or exposed sensitive information can provide attackers with easy access. 
To avoid security misconfigurations:

-Regularly update and patch all software components used in the application.<br/>
-Apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and components have only the necessary permissions.<br/>
-Disable unnecessary services, ports, and features.

# Explain what SQL injection is and how to protect against it.
SQL Injection is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into the input fields of a web application. 
If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user input, this malicious code can be executed against the database, leading to unauthorized access, 
data manipulation, or even data leakage.<br />
<br />
Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats. Reject any inputs that contain unexpected characters or patterns.
